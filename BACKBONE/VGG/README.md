VERY DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NETWORKS FOR LARGE-SCALE IMAGE RECOGNITION



In this work we investigate the effect of the convolutional network depth on its accuracy 
in the large-scale image recognition setting.
The network only use very small convolution filters and increases the depth of network 
which shows a significant improvement for the accuracy.
There ara six different network proposed

very small (3×3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement
on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16–19
weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014
submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation
and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations
generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We
have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate
further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.
